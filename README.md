Projects that entail sql database with python

I first created a database shell in the mysql bench using the hope_hosp.sql file in this repository.
I initailly created the schema "hope_hosp"
I then coded the sql commands that creates the respective 5 tables "Patients, departments, doctors, nurses and faculty" with their relations
I then went on to create a python code GUI on Pycharm that executes  the 4 commands CRUD on the hope_hosp database.
